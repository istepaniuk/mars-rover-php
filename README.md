Source: Widespread kata, generally atributed to the Dallas Hack Club.

Description
-----------
Develop an API that moves a rover around the red planet.

* You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (N,S,E,W) it is facing.
* The rover receives a character array of commands.
* The commands are used to move forward and backward (F,B) and to turn left or right by 90 degrees (L, R).
* The coordinate system is such that the grid wraps around its edges. (planets are spheres after all)
* Given a list of cooridnates that represent obstacles, together with the list of commands to execute, the rover must stop at the last posible position and report the obstacle.
